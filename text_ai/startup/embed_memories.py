    # =====================================================
    # MEMORY RECONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES
    # =====================================================

    "Memory reconstruction combines partial clues from multiple sources to estimate the most likely scene or event.",

    "Visual clues, audio clues, location clues, people, activities, and sensory information can be combined to rebuild forgotten experiences.",

    "Strong memory reconstruction relies on integrating multiple independent clues rather than relying on a single detail.",

    "When exact details are unavailable, memory reconstruction should generate the most plausible scene supported by evidence.",

    "Memory reconstruction should prioritize coherence, context, and available evidence while avoiding fabrication.",

    # =====================================================
    # EMOTIONAL CONTEXT
    # =====================================================

    "Positive memories often involve family connection, social interaction, celebrations, recreation, achievement, and shared experiences.",

    "Emotionally meaningful memories are often reinforced by photographs, familiar voices, sensory experiences, and important relationships.",

    # =====================================================
    # MULTIMODAL REASONING
    # =====================================================

    "Combining image observations, audio observations, and textual descriptions often provides a more complete reconstruction than any single source alone.",

    "Multimodal memory reconstruction uses visual, auditory, and contextual evidence to infer likely events and situations.",

    "Multiple weak clues may collectively reveal a strong and coherent memory reconstruction."
